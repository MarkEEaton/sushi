# sushi
This script allows for the automation of fetching of COUNTER reports.

#### To use sushi.py

`sushi.py` fetches COUNTER reports from vendors' SUSHI endpoints. Populate `cred.template` with your SUSHI credentials (as a list of dictionaries), and rename it `cred.py`. Then run: `$ python sushi.py --help` to see how it works.
